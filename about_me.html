        <h1>About me.</h1>
            <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>I was born in Seoul, Korea and first moved to St. Paul, 
                    Minnesota when I was five years old. I have resided in Georgia for the most of my life, 
                and I feel as though I have really integrated myself within American culture.</p>
                <img src="yuri_pic.PNG" alt="yuri_pic" id="yuri_pic_style">
                <p>I love travelling, spending time with my friends, watching movies and shows, 
                    and playing video games in my free time.</p>    
            <h2>Academics</h2>
                <p>I am a 2nd-year CS major from Johns Creek, 
                    GA with threads Info-networks/Intelligence. 
                    I am currently seeking a software engineering 
                    internship for the summer of 2022 to enhance 
                    my skills in programming and team projects. 
                    I would love to work in machine learning and AI 
                    as, during my research at the Lerner Research Institute, 
                    I saw how useful machine learning could be even in the medical field.  
                    I am extremely hardworking and eager to expand 
                    my knowledge constantly in all aspects of 
                    software engineering.</p>
